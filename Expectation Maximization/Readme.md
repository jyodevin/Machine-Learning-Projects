The Log likelihood by taking 3 Gaussian resulting from the EM algorithm is: LogLikelihood = 284.9947

By changing the number of gaussians, we get various results:

By taking the number of Gaussians to be 2, we get the following results LogLikelihood = 174.3186

By taking the number of Gaussians to be 4, we get the following results LogLikelihood = 285.2557
